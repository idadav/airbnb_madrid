    avg_houses = mean(host_listings_count, na.rm=TRUE),

# With these new factor levels, lets plot some initial histograms to see if we can visualise any differences

ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(x=price)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill=level), position="dodge", binwidth=40) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(x="€ price", title="price per night / houses owned")

ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(x=review_scores_rating)) +

```
From looking at the above, it does indeed look like the hosts with a high amount of houses listed (>3) 
have a higher price but lower ratings (they are more previalent in the higher price areas and lower rating areas 
compared to med and low owners). Lets see if we can confirm these differences with statistical tests.

We run an anova test to see if there is enough evidence to claim that at least two means in price vs amount of 
houses owned are different. Our hypotheses follows:

$$
\left\{ \begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: &\mu_{pLOW} = \mu_{pMED} = \mu_{pHIGH}  \\
H_a: & \text{ at least two means are different} 
\end{eqnarray*} \right.
$$

```{r}
# anova test for price
price_a = aov(data=airbnb_hosts, price ~ level)
summary(price_a)

# post hoc analysis
TukeyHSD(price_a)
plot(TukeyHSD(price_a))

```
Conclusion: since p-value is less than alpha, so we REJECT H0. There is enough evidence to claim that the average 
price between the amount of houses owned are different. Our post hoc analysis confirms this.

Next, we run the same anova test but this time for the review ratings:
$$
\left\{ \begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: &\mu_{rLOW} = \mu_{rMED} = \mu_{rHIGH}  \\
H_a: & \text{ at least two means are different} 
\end{eqnarray*} \right.
$$

```{r}
# anova test for review ratings
rating_a = aov(data=airbnb_hosts, review_scores_rating ~ level)
summary(rating_a)

# post hoc analysis
TukeyHSD(rating_a)
plot(TukeyHSD(rating_a))

```
Conclusion: since p-value is less than alpha, so we REJECT H0. 
There is enough evidence to claim that the average review score between the amount of houses owned are different. 
We can see verify this with our post hoc analysis.

Assessing normality:
```{r}
# normality for price
ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(sample=scale(price))) + stat_qq() + 
   facet_wrap(~ level, nrow=3) + geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1)

# normality for ratings
ggplot(data=airbnb_hosts, aes(sample=scale(review_scores_rating))) + stat_qq() + 
   facet_wrap(~ level, nrow=3) + geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1)

```
Overall conclusion of amount of houses owned is that there are differences in price and average ratings depending 
on how many houses the host owns. Maybe this could be due to companies listing their houses on airbnb and thus 
charging more and giving less of a personal service expected when renting someones home/room in someones home at airbnb.
